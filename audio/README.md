# Audio Files

This directory should contain 8 MP3 files for sound effects:

- `sound1.mp3`
- `sound2.mp3`
- `sound3.mp3`
- `sound4.mp3`
- `sound5.mp3`
- `sound6.mp3`
- `sound7.mp3`
- `sound8.mp3`

Place your MP3 audio files here with these names. The API will trigger playback of these files when called with the corresponding button number (1-8).

You can use any audio files you want - sound effects, music, voice clips, etc.
